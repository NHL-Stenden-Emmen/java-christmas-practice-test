# Case Intratuin

## Assignment 1
Make the classes for the Christmas trees, Christmas lights and Christmas balls.

## Assignment 2
Make a method in the Christmas tree that turns on the Christmas lights (if the tree has any).

## Assignment 3
Make the `Intratuin` class. This class should hold all the products that have a price label.

## Assignment 4
Make a method in `Intratuin` that prints all the products in the store: their price and information about the product.

Example:
```text
Christmas Tree; Nordmann; Height: 1,50m; &euro; 30,-
Christmas Ball; Blue; 25cm; &euro; 1,-
Christmas Lights; Purple; 30m; &euro; 20,-
```

## Assignment 5
Make a method in Intratuin that turns on all the Christmas trees lightning (based on the list of all products).
*Hint: To make your code more readable: make a method in the `Intratuin` class that only returns Christmas trees.*

## Assignment 6
Make Unit tests for the application. Make at least one for the Christmas ball to test the exception.
