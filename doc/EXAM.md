Christmas tree. The Intratuin sells a lot of Christmas trees and articles. You are going to keep track of all their 
products, including decorated show model Christmas trees that are in the showroom of The Intratuin.

There are three different types of Christmas trees: Norway spruce, Nordmann and the fake plastic one. Every tree has a

Every tree can be decorated with a different type of light string. One tree can have only one type of light string. 
Lights are available in predefined lengths: 1m, 5m, 10m or 30m. There are different types of lights available. These 
types are white, red and purple. All the strings consists of RGB LEDs. In every string there fits ten LEDs in one meter. 
A LED consists of a red, green and blue diode. If a diode is turned on it is marked as true, false otherwise. When the 
white string is turned on all the diode are turned on. For the red string al the red diodes, and for the purple one all 
the red and blue ones.

A Christmas tree also has Christmas balls. A ball has a diameter (in cm), a certain color and a price. The diameter is 
variable. When the ball is created the diameter should be provided. The balls are available in predefined colors: 
blue, red, gold and white.

**mandatory**! You should use the prices as found in the table below. Don’t forget that if a Christmas tree is 
decorated, the price of the decoration should be included in the price of the tree.
